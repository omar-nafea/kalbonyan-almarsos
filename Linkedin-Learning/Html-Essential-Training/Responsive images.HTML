<!-- #### Responsive images
We can make several different files and list them as a set of options in our HTML and let the browser 
decide which image to download. It can do so in coordination with the operating system 
while taking the device hardware capabilities and the network speed into account as well.
the pixel denisty of screen is 1X 2X 3X . The simplest way to support these different screens is to create 
multiple copies of our image in different resolutions and then tell the browser that those copies are available. -->
<!-- The aspect ratio is what's important here. And 480 by 360 calculates to a four by three aspect ratio. All of these
photos are four by three. Now, -->
<!-- let's add a source set attribute. Inside of it, we'll list the images that we are
offering the browser as choices. It's a comma separated list. With a URL to a file, a space, the resolution, like 2X,
3X, 4X, 1.5X, whatever, a comma, and the next one. Now, the browser will swap out one version of this image for another
based on what it thinks is best. This is a great solution for providing different size images to handle retina and high
DPI screens. -->

<!-- let browser consider the width of the viewport and to choose a file based on the size of the screen as well as the
density, instead of saying one x, two x, we'll tell the browser how wide each file is, 480w, 960w
That means 480 pixels wide, 960 pixels wide. Now the browser will dynamically choose
which image to display based on a combination of device density and viewport width. This is not going to pick the right
size image for the layout that you have. It's choosing the image based on an assumption that you need the image to be
100% of the viewport width. -->
br
<!-- system is designed to be fast and for the browser to make a decision about which image to download as early as possible
in the page loading process. It chooses the image file before the CSS has been parsed and before layout has happened. -->
br
<!-- Srcset gives you two options for communicating to the browser that there are a set of images available to use. You
can specify which images are for which resolution of screen, or you can indicate which image has how many pixels and let
the browser choose an image based on the combination of screen density and viewport width. The sizes attribute gives you
a way to specify for the browser how much of the viewport's width that image will take up at which break point. -->
<!-- with replacing w with x you maintain the viewport is 100% width and in the same time change the resolution according to the size of screen its all about aspect ratio -->
